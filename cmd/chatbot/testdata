[01:04:42] <Moose> I’ve always enjoyed the picture ads from an outdoor apparel company called The North Face. So, I tried to create an illustration with that same atmosphere, but with a moe twist to it. Here, I’ve paired the suspense of a single finger supporting your entire weight with the suspense of girls going through puberty (I’m insane). The skirt and the harness turned out surprisingly erotic. A very fortune mistake, indeed.
[01:04:46] <Moose> I think this sounds okay?
[01:05:03] <Moose> but maybe.... outdoor apparel brand...?
[01:05:14] <Pabe> outdoor clothing?
[01:05:22] <Pabe> that's north face for you
[01:05:23] <Moose> apparel is fine imo
[01:05:30] <Pabe> idk that word
[01:05:31] <Moose> it's the word after apparel I'm worried about
[01:05:41] <Pabe> brand is better
[01:05:44] <Moose> it's a fancier word for various kinds of clothing you put on your body.
[01:05:59] <Moose> and maybe not just clothing but other things too
[01:06:03] <Moose> like bags
[01:06:05] <Moose> and shit
[01:06:09] <Pabe> okay
[01:06:16] <Pabe> I think north face does only clothes tho
[01:06:19] <Pabe> but I'm not sure
[01:06:31] <Pabe> anyway I'm gonna take a break and go out with my family for a bit
[01:06:36] <Pabe> and continue lettering after
[01:06:38] <Moose> okay
[01:06:39] <Moose> and nope
[01:06:41] <Moose> they dont just do clothes
[01:06:42] <TsunTsun> enjoy
[01:06:46] <Moose> looks like they do hiking equipment too
[01:06:47] <Moose> and shoes
[01:06:50] <Pabe> will take irc with phone with me  lol
[01:06:52] <Moose> and tents!
[01:06:55] <Moose> okay
[01:06:56] <Pabe> oh yeah
[01:06:58] <Pabe> silly me
[01:08:10] <TsunTsun> they do jackets too
[01:09:51] <Moose> indeed
[01:09:57] <Moose> I basically only wear their jackets
[01:09:58] <Moose> love em to pieces
[01:10:08] <Moose> still have the one I got when I was 15 and it's perfectly fine
[01:10:09] <Moose> This short is an extension of the world behind “K2 The School Route On The East Face” on page 111. I wanted the disaster that occurs to be as life-threatening as the ones that took place in The Summit of the Gods and The Climber (manga version for both), but I wouldn’t be able to end the series in a few pages if I did that. So, I forced myself to change directions and go with a story about cute underwear. “Karakorum” is the name of the secon
